In programming the Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself (DRY) is one of most known and common practices.
1. The Don&amp;rsquo;t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle The main idea behind the DRY principle is to avoid duplication of knowledge in order to reduce the risk of defects appearing when new code is introduced in the future.
